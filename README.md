I'm excited to share with you my latest project - a dashboard showcasing crime statistics in the United States. 🇺🇸

**📊 Dashboard Highlights:**

Total Crime Numbers: Explore the overall crime figures, giving you an overview of the current state of safety in the nation.

Top 10 States vs. Rape Crime: Discover the states with the highest reported incidents of rape crimes. Knowledge is power, and 
Understanding these trends can help us address important issues.

Interactive Map Chart: Visualize crime data across all 52 states on an interactive map. Get a clear picture of the geographical distribution of crime rates.

Slicer for State-wise Data: Filter the dashboard by state name using a simple slicer. This allows you to delve deeper into specific states and their 
respective crime statistics.

🤔 Why This Dashboard Matters:
Understanding crime trends is crucial for our communities' safety and well-being. By exploring this dashboard, we can identify areas that need attention and
celebrate the progress made in crime prevention.

🔍 Data Source:
All the information presented in the dashboard is sourced from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, a reliable and comprehensive dataset.

📈 Stay Informed, Stay Safe:
